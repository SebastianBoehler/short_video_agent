scrap completly as it doesntl apply alpha right and person per segment is different so we need new approach

also develop in stages and verif yincremental to save costs.

reference images of speaker need to be passed as well as product image if its an ad

1. generate person with input image of speaker
   have an picutre an input frame of persona, multiple inputs / different personas

2. get alpha mask / green screen video. apply it and overlay onto something

3. composite the generated person with the alpha mask onto the background

4. generate start images for scenes and use text to video with start frame image

5. stitch everything together into final video

6. add audio (voiceover, background music, sound effects)

7. add text overlays for captions/transcript
